OCAML-SIMPLEX
*************

OCaml module that provides a persistent implementation of a variant of the simplex algorithm to check
for the satisfiability of a given system of linear equations/inequalities.

Dependencies
------------

Requires the following in order to compile :
- zarith
- ocamlbuild
- ocamlfind

Build
-----

'make' will compile the simplex module and the main executable to allow for some tests.
'make lib' will compile the simplex library (can be found after in _build/simplex.cmx[a]).
'make doc' will compile the documentation generated by ocamldoc, which can be then found in
lib.docdir/index.html.

Tests
-----

The main.ml file defines functions to generate random linear systems and then try and solve them.
