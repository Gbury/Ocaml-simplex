OCAML-SIMPLEX
*************

OCaml module that provides a persistent implementation of a variant of the simplex algorithm to check
for the satisfiability of a given system of linear equations/inequalities.

Dependencies
------------

Requires the following in order to compile :
- zarith
- ocamlbuild
- ocamlfind

Build
-----

A simple 'make' will compile the simplex module and the main executable to allow for some tests.
'make doc' will compile the documentation generated by ocamldoc, which can be then found in
lib.docdir/index.html

Tests
-----

The main.ml file defines functions to generate random linear systems and then try and solve them.
